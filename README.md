# Seinfeld_etl

Sometimes the hardest question for data collection can be "What do you have that you're passionate about?" Unfortunately when asked questions such as those your mind goes blank and all you can think is "nothing", well out of that "nothing" came the inspiration to do a Seinfeld ETL. This project shows how webscraping, transforming the data collected, then putting into a database can be used for many applications. While we used Seinfeld some practical applications could be a sentiment analysis that is used to see if a sequel to a movie would be well received, or if a new product launch will go well based on previous reviews.

Python, pandas, and SQL were used to put this project together. We built the code using Jupyter Notebook and PGAdmin4.
